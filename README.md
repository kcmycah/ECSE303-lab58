## Aim

This lab is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing an HTML frontend application and RESTful API server.

## Requirements

Now that the backend server has been fully implemented, now all that's left is to to design and implement a user friendly GUI (graphical user interface) for the tank management application.

This version of the frontend app should act as a mock-up to show what the final application could look like. Consider it a first draft. 

**HTML and CSS**

The objective is to design an appropriate card design in HTML. These cards should be designed to display all the attributes of each tank object and the user profile object.

The HTML layout of a tank object can as simple or as complex a design as desired, as long as it makes sense. That being said, it should be known that you will not be graded on aesthetics or visual appearance. Full marks will be awarded as long as all requirements are met.

Your design should display at least 4 tank cards.
